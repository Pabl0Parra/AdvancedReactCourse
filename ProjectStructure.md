# Describe in a few lines which structure would you use to organize your React project and why

---

I believe the analogy between how organisms are built in nature and how our interfaces are built is a really good way to organize our projects folders & files.

Atomic design is a methodology composed of five distinct stages. They work together to create an interface design system in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner. These five stages consist of Atoms -> molecules -> organisms -> templates and pages. Each stage plays a key role in the hierarchy of our interface design system.

I like this approach because:

- It provides better organization (helps organize files & components in an understandable & predictable way).

- Better architectural design (if you think of components as atoms, molecules & organisms, this puts your focus on the reusability of the componets).

- No boundaries (it can be applied to different languages or frameworks, not just on a React project).

Further on, it offers you a number of major benefits like:

- Faster prototyping.

- Easier updates and revisions.

- Improved consistency.

- Less cross-checking while testing.

- Eliminated errors.

- System acts as a single source of truth.
